    <h3>Ballet</h3>
    <p>Ballet dancers typically begin training between the ages of 6 and 8 (for females) and 5 and 7 (for male dancers) if they desire to perform professionally. Training does not end when ballet dancers are hired by a professional company. 
        Ballet is a strict form of art, and the dancer must be very athletic and flexible.[citation needed]
Ballet dancers begin their classes at the barre, a wooden beam that runs along the walls of the ballet studio. Dancers use the barre to support themselves during exercises. Barre work is designed to warm up the body and stretch muscles to prepare for center work, where they execute exercises without the barre. Center work in the middle of the room starts out with slower exercises, gradually leading up to faster exercises and larger movements. 
Ballet dancers finish center work practicing big leaps across the floor, which is called grande allegro.

        <h3>Hip Hop</h3>
        <p>Hip Hop Dance is a style of movement characterized by bounces and rocks executed to Hip Hop music. It has deep historical and social roots in African American culture, having emerged in Black communities living in 1970s New York
            Breaking, later known as "breakdancing," is a style of dance that was born through these parties.

Herc originally called these dancers break boys (b-boys) and break girls (b-girls) â€“ because they danced to his breakbeats that he looped.

Early Breaking also incorporated steps from a standing position and drops to the ground.

It also involved gestures associated with mock-battle forms, and movement on the ground including spins and freezes.

        <h3>Belly dance</h3>
        <p>Belly dance is primarily a torso-driven dance, with an emphasis on articulations of the hips. Unlike many Western dance forms, the focus of the dance is on isolations of the torso muscles, rather than on movements of the limbs through space. Although some of these isolations appear similar to the isolations used in jazz ballet, they are sometimes driven differently and have a different feeling or emphasis.

            In common with most folk dances, there is no universal naming scheme for belly dance movements. Some dancers and dance schools have developed their own naming schemes, but none of these is universally recognized.</p>
